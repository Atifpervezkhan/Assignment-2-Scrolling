        Karachi (/kəˈrɑːtʃi/; Urdu: کراچی; Sindhi: ڪراچي; IPA: [kəˈraːtʃi] (listen)) is the most 
        populous city in Pakistan and 12th most populous city in the world, with a population of over 
        20 million.[18][19][20] It is situated at the southern tip of the country along the Arabian Sea coast.
         It is the former capital of Pakistan and capital of the province of Sindh. Ranked as a beta-global city,[21][22] it is Pakistan's premier industrial and financial centre,[23] with an estimated GDP of over $200 billion (PPP) as of 2021.[16][17] Karachi paid $9billion (25% of whole country) as tax during fiscal year July 2021 to May 2022 according to FBR report. 
        Karachi is Pakistan's most cosmopolitan city, linguistically, ethnically, and religiously diverse,[24] 
        as well as one of Pakistan's most secular and socially liberal cities.[25][26][27] Karachi serves as 
        a transport hub, and contains Pakistan’s two largest seaports, the Port of Karachi and Port Qasim, as 
        well as Pakistan's busiest airport, Jinnah International Airport.[28] Karachi is also a media center, 
        home to news channels, film and fashion industry of Pakistan. Most of Pakistan's multinational companies 
        and banks have their headquarters in Karachi. Karachi is also a tourism hub due to its scenic beaches, 
        historic buildings and shopping malls.

        The region has been inhabited for millennia,[29] but the city was formally founded as the 
        fortified village of Kolachi as recently as 1729.[30][31] The settlement greatly increased in 
        importance on arrival of the East India Company in the mid-19th century. British administrators 
        embarked on substantial projects to transform the city into a major seaport, and connect it with the 
        extensive railway network of the Indian subcontinent.[31] At the time of the partition of India in 1947, 
        the city was the largest in Sindh with an estimated population of 400,000 people.[24] Following the independence 
        of Pakistan, the city experienced a dramatic shift in population and demography with the arrival of hundreds of thousands of Muhajir (Urdu-speaking people) Muslim refugees from India,[32] coupled with a substantial exodus of its Hindu residents, whose numbers declined from 51.1% to 1.7% of the total population.[33][34] The city experienced rapid economic growth following Pakistan's independence, attracting migrants from throughout the country and other regions in South Asia.[35] According to the 2017 Census of Pakistan, Karachi's total population was 16,051,521, with 14.9 million of those people residing in the urban areas of the city. Karachi is one of the world's fastest-growing cities,[36] and has significant communities representing almost every ethnic group in Pakistan. Karachi holds more than two
         million Bangladeshi immigrants, a million Afghan refugees, and up to 400,000 Rohingyas from 
         Myanmar.[37][38][39]

        Karachi is now Pakistan's premier industrial and financial centre. The city has a formal economy estimated to be worth $190 billion as of 2021, which is the largest in the country.[40][41] Karachi collects 35% of Pakistan's tax revenue,[42] and generates approximately 25% of Pakistan's entire GDP.[43][44] Approximately 30% of Pakistani industrial output is from Karachi,[45] while Karachi's ports handle approximately 95% of Pakistan's foreign trade.[46] Approximately 90% of the multinational corporations and 100% of banks operating in Pakistan are headquartered in Karachi.[46] Karachi is considered to be Pakistan's fashion capital,[47][48] and has hosted the annual Karachi Fashion Week since 2009.[49][50]
        Known as the "City of Lights" in the 1960s and 1970s for its vibrant nightlife,[51]
         Karachi was beset by sharp ethnic, sectarian, and political conflict in the 1980s with the 
         large-scale arrival of weaponry during the Soviet–Afghan War.[52] The city had become well known
          for its high rates of violent crime, but recorded crimes sharply decreased following a crackdown
           operation against criminals, the MQM political party, and Islamist militants, initiated in 2013 by 
           the Pakistan Rangers.[53] As a result of the operation, Karachi dropped from being ranked the world's
           6th-most dangerous city for crime in 2014, to 128th by 2022.[54]

        Before independence, the city was widely known as Karanchi in Urdu, though the English spelling Karachi became more popular over time.[55]
        Modern Karachi was reputedly founded in 1729 as the settlement of Kolachi-jo-Goth during the 
        rule of Kalhora dynasty.[30] The new settlement is said to have been named in honour of Mai Kolachi,
         whose son is said to have slain a man-eating crocodile in the village after his elder brothers had already
          been killed by it.[30] The name Karachee, a shortened and corrupted version of the original name Kolachi-jo-Goth,
           was used for the first time in a Dutch report from 1742 about a shipwreck near the settlement.[56][57]

<h1 id ="mid4">Early history</h1>

<p>
The 15th–18th century Chaukhandi tombs are a Tentative UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The region around Karachi has been the site of human habitation for millennia. Upper Paleolithic
 and Mesolithic sites have been excavated in the Mulri Hills along Karachi's northern outskirts. These earliest inhabitants are believed to have been hunter-gatherers, with ancient flint tools discovered at several sites.

The expansive Karachi region is believed to have been known to the ancient Greeks, and may have been the 
site of Barbarikon, an ancient seaport which was located at the nearby mouth of the Indus River.[58][59][60][61] 
Karachi may also have been referred to as Ramya in ancient Greek texts.[62]

The ancient site of Krokola, a natural harbor west of the Indus where Alexander the Great sailed his fleet 
for Achaemenid Assyria, may have been located near the mouth of Karachi's Malir River,[63][64][65] though 
some believe it was located near Gizri.[66][67] No other natural harbor exists near the mouth of the Indus that could accommodate a large fleet.[68] Nearchus, who commanded Alexander's naval fleet, also mentioned a hilly island by the name of Morontobara and an adjacent flat island named Bibakta, which colonial historians identified as Karachi's Manora Point and Kiamari (or Clifton), respectively, based on Greek descriptions.[69][70][71] Both areas were island until well into the colonial era, when silting in led to them being connected to the mainland.[72]

In 711 CE, Muhammad bin Qasim conquered the Sindh and Indus Valley and the port of Debal, from where he launched 
his forces further into the Indus Valley in 712.[73] Some have identified the port with Karachi, though some argue the location was somewhere between Karachi and the nearby city of Thatta.[74][75]

Under Mirza Ghazi Beg, the Mughal administrator of Sindh, the development of coastal Sindh and the Indus River 
Delta was encouraged. Under his rule, fortifications in the region acted as a bulwark against Portuguese incursions 
into Sindh. In 1553–54, Ottoman admiral Seydi Ali Reis, mentioned a small port along the Sindh coast by the name of 
Kaurashi which may have been Karachi.[76][77][78] The Chaukhandi tombs in Karachi's modern suburbs were built around
 this time between the 15th and 18th centuries.

 <p>


The Manora Fort, built-in 1797 to defend Karachi, was captured by the British on 3 February 1839 and upgraded 1888–1889.
19th century Karachi historian Seth Naomal Hotchand recorded that a small settlement of 20–25 huts 
existed along the Karachi Harbour that was known as Dibro, which was situated along a pool of water known as Kolachi-jo-Kun.[79] In 1725, a band of Baloch settlers from Makran and Kalat had settled in the hamlet after fleeing droughts and tribal feuds.[80]

A new settlement was built in 1729 at the site of Dibro, which came to be known as Kolachi-jo-Goth
 ("The village of Kolachi").[30] The new settlement is said to have been named in honour of Mai Kolachi, a resident of the old settlement whose son is said to have slain a man-eating crocodile.[30] Kolachi was about 40 hectares in size, with some smaller fishing villages scattered in its vicinity.[81] The founders of the new fortified settlement were Sindhi Baniyas,[80] and are said to have arrived from the nearby town of Kharak Bandar after the harbour there silted in 1728 after heavy rains.[82] Kolachi was fortified, and defended with cannons imported from Muscat, Oman. Under the Talpurs, the Rah-i-Bandar road was built to connect the city's port to the caravan terminals.[83] This road would eventually be further developed by the British into Bandar Road, which was renamed Muhammad Ali Jinnah Road.[84][85]

The name Karachee was used for the first time in a Dutch document from 1742, in which a merchant ship de
 Ridderkerk is shipwrecked near the settlement.[56][57] In 1770s, Karachi came under the control of the Khan
  of Kalat, which attracted a second wave of Balochi settlers.[80] In 1795, Karachi was annexed by the Talpurs, 
  triggering a third wave of Balochi settlers who arrived from interior Sindh and southern Punjab.[80] The Talpurs built the Manora Fort in 1797,[86][87] which was used to protect Karachi's Harbor from al-Qasimi pirates.[88]

In 1799 or 1800, the founder of the Talpur dynasty, Mir Fateh Ali Khan, allowed the East India Company under
 Nathan Crow to establish a trading post in Karachi.[89] He was allowed to build a house for himself in Karachi 
 at that time, but by 1802 was ordered to leave the city.[90] The city continued to be ruled by the Talpurs until 
 it was occupied by forces under the command of John Keane in February 1839.[91]
